# Dart2GDevelop
A Dart To Javascript Converter For GDevelop

The Dart And Javascript Syntax Is Very Similar (Which I Realized Quickly When Programming This). Although, there is a difference with how variables are established, which I programmed.

To Build:
Use the make tool that comes with your c++ compiler to build the Makefile. (Will release a binary soon).

So far:
I have programmed a conversion from dart variables to javascript variables.

Soon:
I will program linking between voids and classes and transferring that to a javascript file. I will also try to build this cli tool as a binary for windows and maybe make it usable via a html website. I will also make it easier to implement the javascript output to GDevelop.
